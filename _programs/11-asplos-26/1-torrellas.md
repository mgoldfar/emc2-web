The global electricity demand from data centers, AI, and cryptocurrencies in expected to be around 800TW/h by the end of 2026. Currently, companies like Oracle are building 500MW AI campuses. Training a single model takes 100+ MW over many months, with clusters of about 100K GPUs, and the projected AI cluster size is expected to increase several times in the next few years. Clearly, power will be the primary limiter to the growth of AI. Given this scenario, what can we, researchers, do? In this talk, I will discuss the problem and suggest some techniques that we can use to try to mitigate it. Some of the ideas are being developed in the context of the ACE Center for Evolvable Computing, a center funded by SRC and DARPA for efficient distributed computing.
