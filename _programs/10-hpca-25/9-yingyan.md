As large language models (LLMs) continue to transform applications in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning, there is an ever‐increasing need for more efficient, flexible, and high‐performing solutions. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work in advancing LLM efficiency through innovative architecture, any‐shape flexibility, and multiplication‐less reparameterization. Collectively, these techniques provide a multi‐layered strategy for building faster, lighter, and more agile LLMs, extending the frontiers of efficient language intelligence across diverse deployment scenarios.
