<a href="">Slides</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jgX_Jw5rPPaxBte6yPugn-1keOJHmtGj/view?usp=share_link">Video</a><br>In recent years, computer architecture research has been enriched by the advent of machine learning (ML) techniques. In this talk, we will discuss the interplay between ML and designing domain specific architectures. Then, we will delve into the synergies between these two domains, highlighting their collaborative potential to advance design of computer systems. We will explore the diverse range of opportunities that ML affords for optimizing various aspects across the entire compute stack, from algorithmic to system-level optimization. Furthermore, we will embark on a journey towards Architecture 2.0, envisioning a future where ML-assisted architecture research takes center stage. This discussion will emphasize the importance of nurturing and fostering a community that embraces data-driven solutions in computer architecture design.
