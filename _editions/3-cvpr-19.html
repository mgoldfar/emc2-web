        Due to the half-day schedule and overwhelming responses received, we are forced to skip short paper presentation track from
        the <a href="cvpr-19">3rd edition</a> of EMC2. Please consider submitting your workshop paper to the <a href="isca-19">4th edition</a>
        of EMC2 co-located with ISCA 2019.</p>
