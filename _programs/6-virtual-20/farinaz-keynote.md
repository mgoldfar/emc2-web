Machine Learning on encrypted data is a yet-to-be-addressed challenge. Several recent key advances across different layers of the system, from cryptography and mathematics to logic synthesis and hardware are paving the way for energy-efficient realization of privacy preserving computing for certain target applications.
This keynote talk highlights the crucial role of hardware and advances in computing architecture in supporting the recent progresses in the field. I outline the main technologies and mixed computing models. I particularly center my talk on the recent progress in synthesis of Garbled Circuits that provide a leap in scalable realization of energy efficient machine learning on encrypted data.  I explore how hardware could pave the way for navigating the complex parameter selection and scalable future mixed protocol solutions. I conclude by briefly discussing the challenges and opportunities moving forward.

**Farinaz Koushanfar** is a professor and Henry Booker Faculty Scholar in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at University of California San Diego (UCSD), where she is also the co-founder and co-director of the UCSD Center for Machine-Integrated Computing & Security (MICS). Her research addresses several aspects of efficient computing and embedded systems, with a focus on hardware and system security, real-time/energy-efficient big data analytics under resource constraints, design automation and synthesis for emerging applications, as well as practical privacy-preserving computing. Dr. Koushanfar is a fellow of the Kavli Foundation Frontiers of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of IEEE. She has received a number of awards and honors including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) from President Obama, the ACM SIGDA Outstanding New Faculty Award, Cisco IoT Security Grand Challenge Award, MIT Technology Review TR-35 2008, as well as Young Faculty/CAREER Awards from NSF, DARPA, ONR and ARO.
