      <p>
        As artificial intelligence and other forms of cognitive computing continue to proliferate into new domains, many
        forums for dialogue and knowledge sharing have emerged. In the proposed workshop, the primary focus is on the
        exploration of energy efficient techniques and architectures for cognitive computing and machine learning, particularly
        for applications and systems running at the edge. For such resource constrained environments, performance alone is never
        sufficient, requiring system designers to carefully balance performance with power, energy, and area (overall PPA metric).
      </p>
      <p>The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers who are exploring novel ideas in the field of
        energy efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence for embedded applications. We also hope to provide a
        solid platform for forging relationships and exchange of ideas between the industry and the academic world through
        discussions and active collaborations.</p>

    <p>
      A new wave of intelligent computing, driven by recent advances in machine learning and cognitive algorithms
      coupled with process technology and new design methodologies, has the potential to usher unprecedented disruption
      in the way conventional computing solutions are designed and deployed. These new and innovative approaches often
      provide an attractive and efficient alternative not only in terms of performance but also power, energy, and area.
      This disruption is easily visible across the whole spectrum of computing systems -- ranging from low end mobile
      devices to large scale data centers and servers.</p>
    <p>A key class of these intelligent solutions is providing real-time, on-device cognition at the edge to enable many
      novel applications including vision and image processing, language translation, autonomous driving, malware
      detection, and gesture recognition. Naturally, these applications have diverse requirements for
      performance,energy, reliability, accuracy, and security that demand a holistic approach to designing the hardware,
      software, and intelligence algorithms to achieve the best power, performance, and area (PPA).</p>
