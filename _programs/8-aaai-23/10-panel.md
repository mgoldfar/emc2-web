Growth in popularity and complexity of AI has fueled massive investment in ASIC designs for AI. These are often targeted towards a sub-class of AI/ML such as transformers or conv nets. This panels will discuss the implications of such focused designs on the HW vendors, data centers, end users, standard groups, and data scientists. Are there niches that justify such specializations or are we creating hardware solutions for a field which will likely continue to evolve rapidly?
