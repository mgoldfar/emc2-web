Recommender models are an important class of applications, however, transformative effects of these large models are predicated on providing high-performance compute capabilities to enable these learning algorithms. As the new age data-centers become heterogeneous with these emerging domain specific hardware, we must rethink both the architecture and the corresponding system stack. In this talk, I will describe our work in creating novel architectures, systems, and frameworks that leverage statistical properties of data to best utilize the heterogeneous compute and memory resources for recommender model training.
