For decades, systems researchers have balanced competing objectives: latency versus throughput, performance versus power, and speed versus cost. Traditionally, accuracy was a fixed requirement—non-negotiable and external to the systems equation. But as modern computing increasingly hosts AI-driven workloads, accuracy itself has become a tunable system variable. In this talk, I'll argue that the next frontier in systems design lies in treating accuracy as a first-class performance knob, to be traded for efficiency in a principled way. Drawing from our recent work, I will show how software–hardware co-design can explicitly expose, quantify, and manage the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.
