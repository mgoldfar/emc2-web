Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in healthcare and our understanding of life. Recent years saw exponential increase in genomic data, far outpacing Moore’s Law. Coupled with prohibitively high computational costs of bioinformatics tasks, it presents a challenge but also a great opportunity for hardware acceleration.

I will describe a typical genomic assembly pipeline, and discuss the latest developments in the field of DNA sequencing, with an emphasis on hardware acceleration opportunities. Afterwards, I will make a brief excurse into the world of existing bioinformatics accelerators. I will end up with the insights from the Accelerator Architecture for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (AACBB) 2019 workshop.

**Leonid Yavits** received his MSc (1996) and PhD in Electrical Engineering (2015) from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. After graduating the MSc program, he co-founded VisionTech where he co-designed the world's first single chip MPEG2 codec. Following VisionTech’s acquisition by Broadcom, he managed Broadcom Israel R&D and co-developed a number of video compression products. Later Leonid co-founded Horizon Semiconductors where he co-designed a Set Top Box-on-chip for cable and satellite TV. Horizon's Set Top Box-on-chip was among world's earliest heterogeneous MPSoC.  

Leonid is a postdoc research fellow in Electrical Engineering at Technion. He co-authored a number of patents and research papers. His research interests include non von Neumann computer architectures; processing in memory and resistive memory based computing; architectures for computational biology and bioinformatics. Leonid's research work has earned several awards; among them: IEEE Computer Architecture Letter Journal Best Paper Awards for 2015 and 2017 and best poster awards at ISC High Performance in 2017 and ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference in 2018.
