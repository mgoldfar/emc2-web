Efficient inference is a problem of great practical interest for both on-device AI and server side applications. In this talk, I will talk about quantization for efficient inference and discuss practical approaches to get the best performance and accuracy when you deploy a model for inference. I will conclude the talk by touching upon sparsity which can provide further performance improvements on top of quantization.  

**Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi** is a software engineer in the Pytorch team at Facebook, where he leads the effort to optimize deep networks for inference, with a focus on quantization. Prior to this he was part of the Tensorflow team at Google working on quantization for mobile inference as part of Tensorflow Lite. From 2001 to 2017, Raghu was at Qualcomm Research, working on several generations of wireless technologies. His work experience also includes computer vision for AR, ultra-low power, always-on vision, hardware/software co-design for inference on mobile platforms and modem development. He is an inventor in more than 90 issued and filed patents. Raghu has a Masters degree in EE from University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign and a Bachelors degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
