Deep Neural Net models have provided the most accurate solutions to a very wide variety of problems in vision, language, and speech; however,  the design, training, and optimization of efficient DNNs typically requires resorting to the “dark arts” of ad hoc methods and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this talk we present our progress on abandoning these dark arts by using Differential Neural Architecture Search to guide the design of efficient DNNs and by using Hessian-based methods to guide the processes of training and quantizing those DNNs.

**Kurt Keutzer's** research at University of California, Berkeley, focuses on computational problems in Deep Learning. In particular, Kurt has worked to reduce the training time of ImageNet to minutes and, with the SqueezeNet family, to develop a family of Deep Neural Networks suitable for mobile and IoT applications.

Before joining Berkeley as a Full Professor in 1998, Kurt was CTO and SVP at Synopsys. Kurt's contributions to Electronic Design Automation were recognized at the 50th Design Automation Conference where he was noted as a Top 10 most cited author, as an author of a Top 10 most cited paper, and as one of only three people to have won four Best Paper Awards at that conference. Kurt was named a Fellow of the IEEE in 1996.
