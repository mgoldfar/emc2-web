The place and route stage from digital design is in fact a combinatorial optimization problem. This has been solved for many devices in several ways over the past decades. Applications of this theoretical problem have been also showcased on quantum simulators and devices. We will go over the specific obstacles encountered in state preparation, mapping high level code to a quantum device, a classical reinforcement learning solution for placing SWAP gates solution, as well as ongoing efforts of adopting a quantum exploration policy. We will also discuss about the importance of scheduling in a hybrid, near term, execution environment, in which HPC classical resources should be used with quantum devices.
