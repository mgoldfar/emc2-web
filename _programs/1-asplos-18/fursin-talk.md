Co-designing efficient machine learning based systems across the whole application/hardware/software stack to trade off speed, accuracy, energy and costs is becoming extremely complex and time consuming. Researchers often struggle to evaluate and compare different published works across rapidly evolving software frameworks, heterogeneous hardware platforms, compilers, libraries, algorithms, data sets, models, and environments. I will present our community effort to develop an open co-design tournament platform with an online public scoreboard based on Collective Knowledge workflow framework (CK). It gradually incorporates best research practices while providing a common way for multidisciplinary researchers to optimize and compare the quality vs. efficiency Pareto optimality of various workloads on diverse and complete hardware/software systems. All the winning solutions will be made available to the community as portable and customizable "plug&play" components with a common API to accelerate research and innovation!

I will then discuss how our open competition and collaboration can help to achieve energy efficiency for cognitive workloads based on energy-efficient submissions from the 1st ReQuEST tournament co-located with ASPLOSâ€™18.

**Grigori Fursin** is the CTO of dividiti and the Chief Scientist of the non-profit cTuning foundation. He is developing an open Collective Knowledge platform to crowdsource multi-objective optimization and co-design of deep learning and other emerging workloads across the whole SW/HW/model stack. Before co-founding dividiti in 2015, he was the head of workload optimization group at Intel Exascale Lab and a senior tenured scientist at INRIA. Grigori has an interdisciplinary background in computer engineering, physics, electronics and machine learning with a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh (2004). He is a recipient of a personal INRIA fellowship for "making an outstanding contribution to research" in 2012 and the ACM CGO "test of time" award in 2017.
