Training the largest known transformer models consume megawatts of power. Yet, we are far less capable compared to the human brain. In this panel, we will ask: What will it take to train models that understand natural languages like our brain can. Would we continue to increase the energy footprint or innovate and find efficient solutions that consume far less and can reach the illustrious capabilities of the human brain?
