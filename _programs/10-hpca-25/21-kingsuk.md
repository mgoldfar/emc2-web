Finetuning and inference options on edge devices and/or the cloud would be discussed. A novel use case of identifying source of pollution in river water in India would be presented. Data feeds from sensor measurements combined with satellite imagery data would be used to train/fine-tune a graph transformer type network, capable of multi-modal fusion of the geo-spatial and water conductivity data. Subsequent integration into a agentic framework using either on-prem and/or on cloud network in a hybrid setting would be discussed. Augmentation of the agentic workflow with an in-house proprietary perception engine would also be introduced. Emphasis would be made on how the different blocks, starting from geo-spatial satellite imagery data collection engine, to real time sensor measurements, integrated via the perception engine, are fed into the specialized LLM network via our Playground dashboard, available via QCOMM cloud AI, and orchestrated into actionable insights, would also be highlighted.
