From Research to Industrialization: learn how Hugging Face is putting Transformers to work! Transformers conquered NLP and are now eating away at all Machine Learning domains. These complex architectures and very large models are creating new engineering challenges for companies to apply them in efficient, scalable production settings. In this session, Jeff will detail how Hugging Face is developing new State of the Art efficiency techniques, and is collaborating with hardware and open source partners including ORT, Intel and NVIDIA, to deliver up to 100x speedups to its customers.
