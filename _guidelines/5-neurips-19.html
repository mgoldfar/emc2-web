</ul>

<h5 class="header">Posters</h5>
<ul class="browser-default list">
    <li>Poster size should be: 36W x 48H inches (90W x 122H cm).</li>
	<li>Poster will be taped to the wall so please use a light paper stock.</li>
	<li>Poster title must match the title of the submitted paper.</li>
	<li>Poster must include author names and affiliations underneath the title.</li>
	<li>Please include <em>The 5th Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing @ NeurIPS 2019</em> on the bottom of your poster.</li>
	<li>Posters should follow a similar format to other NeurIPS posters, but please note no template will be provided.</li>
	<li>Examples may be found on the NeurIPS 2019 poster schedule: <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Poster" target="_blank">https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Poster</a></li>
    <li>Due to time constraints, there will be no formal time set aside for posters during the program but we ask authors to stand by their posters during the breaks to discuss their work with workshop attendees.</li>
    <li>We expect space in the room to be limited so posters will be split into a morning and afternoon session.</li>
</ul>
