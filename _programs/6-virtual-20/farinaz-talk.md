Machine Learning on encrypted data is a yet-to-be-addressed challenge. Several recent key advances across different layers of the system, from cryptography and mathematics to logic synthesis and hardware are paving the way for energy-efficient realization of privacy preserving computing for certain target applications.
This keynote talk highlights the crucial role of hardware and advances in computing architecture in supporting the recent progresses in the field. I outline the main technologies and mixed computing models. I particularly center my talk on the recent progress in synthesis of Garbled Circuits that provide a leap in scalable realization of energy efficient machine learning on encrypted data.  I explore how hardware could pave the way for navigating the complex parameter selection and scalable future mixed protocol solutions. I conclude by briefly discussing the challenges and opportunities moving forward.
