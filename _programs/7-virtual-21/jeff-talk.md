Learn how Hugging Face achieves 100x speedup when serving Transformer models on GPU for its accelerated inference API customers. Transformers has become the default library for data scientists all around the world to explore state-of-the-art NLP models and build new NLP features. While experimenting with models in Transformers is easy, deploying these large models into production with maximum performance, and managing them into an architecture that scales with usage, is hard for any machine learning engineer. Hugging Face will discuss how they achieve 100x performance gain, optimizing their own open source and leveraging the most advanced frameworks to optimize models for inference on specific hardware. In particular, Hugging Face will detail how the flexibility of Triton Inference Server can be combined with the optimized runtime environments of ORT and TensorRT to produce the last 10x speedup on GPU.
