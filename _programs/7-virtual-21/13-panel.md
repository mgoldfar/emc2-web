As AI unlocks new frontiers in automation, science and human understanding, the complexity of AI models continues to grow. So does the need for computational power to train and deploy these models. While much attention has been given to improve energy efficiency in low-power edge devices for inference, the energy cost of AI is equally relevant, if not more, in large scale AI datacenters. With firsthand insights into the world of scalable compute and efficient AI in the cloud, our distinguished panelists discuss the technical and economic aspects of cloud-scale AI and the opportunities and challenges to lower the energy footprint of AI.
