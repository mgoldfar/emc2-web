Wearable augmented reality (AR) devices have the potential to revolutionize user experiences with AI-enabled capabilities. However, the power and size constraints of current memory technologies pose significant challenges to realizing this vision. To overcome these limitations, we must address the memory power and area challenges that hinder the performance of AR/AI workloads in wearable devices. To achieve this goal, we will explore state-of-the-art logic, memory, and advanced packaging technologies, such as 3D SRAM, 3D IPM, and CIM. In this talk, we will introduce three key approaches to overcoming memory limitations and enabling on-device AI and LLM in wearable AR systems: (1) Integrate logic and memory with advanced 3D technologies; (2) Co-optimize memory for workload characteristics; and (3) Design for the end-to-end system. By optimizing memory design and technology solutions for specific workloads and end-to-end systems, we can unlock the full potential of wearable AR devices.
