Recent advances in AI has profoundly affected our perception of the technology. Not only are there domains where AI has reached superhuman performance levels, it is also starting to influence our interaction with machines (courtesy of LLMs).At the same time, observations of emergent properties has excited many in the community as a potential existence proof of future AGI. How and when we get there is an open question though. In this panel we discuss the various elements across algorithm innovation, computing infrastructure, training and data generation, even ethics and governance that need to come together for us to create truly intelligent systems.
