In this talk, Tijmen will introduce two new methods for quantizing your neural networks. AdaRound, which is a new rounding scheme that allows us to quantize several networks to even 4 bit weights, with a small drop in accuracy while not requiring fine-tuning. And Bayesian Bits, a fine-tuning method that allows a network to automatically choose mixed-precision quantization settings and do pruning at the same time.  Both methods have successfully been applied in practice, and make neural network quantization a lot easier for engineers who want to deploy their models to energy efficient devices.

**Tijmen Blankevoort** is a senior staff engineer at Qualcomm, leading the model efficiency research team. From quantization to pruning and neural architecture search, his team is developing new methods to deploy neural networks in the most energy efficient way possible. Before joining Qualcomm, Tijmen has a degree in mathematics from the university of Leiden. Together with Max Welling, he started the deep learning start-up Scyfer as a spin-off from the university of Amsterdam, which was successfully acquired by Qualcomm in 2017. In his spare time, he enjoys playing the card game Magic: the Gathering, and molecular gastronomy cooking.
