There has been a significant amount of research on the topic of efficient processing of DNNs, from the design of efficient DNN algorithms to the design of efficient DNN accelerators. The wide range techniques used for efficient DNN algorithm design has resulted in a more diverse set of DNNs; this creates a new challenge for the DNN accelerators, as they now need to be sufficiently flexible to support a wide range of DNN workloads efficiently. However, many of the existing DNN accelerators rely on certain properties of the DNN which cannot be guaranteed (e.g., fixed weight sparsity, large number of channels, large batch size). In this talk, we will briefly discuss recent techniques that have been used to design efficient DNN algorithms and important properties to consider when applying these techniques. We will then present a systematic approach called Eyexam to identify the sources of inefficiencies in DNN accelerator designs for different DNN workloads. Finally, we will introduce a flexible accelerator called Eyeriss v2 that is computationally efficient across a wide range of diverse DNNs.

**Vivienne Sze** is an Associate Professor at MIT in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.  Her research interests include energy-aware signal processing algorithms, and low-power circuit and system design for portable multimedia applications, including computer vision, deep learning, autonomous navigation, and video process/coding. Prior to joining MIT, she was a Member of Technical Staff in the R&D Center at TI, where she designed low-power algorithms and architectures for video coding. She also represented TI in the JCT-VC committee of ITU-T and ISO/IEC standards body during the development of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which received a Primetime Engineering Emmy Award.  She is a co-editor of the book entitled “High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC): Algorithms and Architectures” (Springer, 2014). 

Prof. Sze received the B.A.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto in 2004, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degree from MIT in 2006 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, she received the Jin-Au Kong Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Prize in Electrical Engineering at MIT.  She is a recipient of the 2018 Facebook Faculty Award, the 2018 & 2017 Qualcomm Faculty Award, the 2018 & 2016 Google Faculty Research Award, the 2016 AFOSR Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) Award, the 2016 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, the 2014 DARPA Young Faculty Award, the 2007 DAC/ISSCC Student Design Contest Award, and a co-recipient of the 2017 CICC Outstanding Invited Paper Award, the 2016 IEEE Micro Top Picks Award and the 2008 A-SSCC Outstanding Design Award.
