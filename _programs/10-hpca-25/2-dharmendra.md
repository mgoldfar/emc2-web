Describing NorthPole, a chip that is the result of nearly two decades of work by scientists at IBM Research and has been an outgrowth of a 14 year partnership with United States Department of Defense (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and Air Force Research Laboratory). NorthPole, implemented using a 12-nm process on-shore in US, outperforms all of the existing specialized chips for running neural networks on ResNet50 and Yolov4, even those using more advanced technology processes.
