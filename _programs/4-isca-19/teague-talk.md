In this talk weâ€™ll cover techniques to do post-training quantization that can improve model accuracy for 8-bit quantization significantly.  These techniques are especially useful when training/fine-tuning is not possible, as case that arises very frequently in commercial applications.  No training pipeline, optimized hyperparameters, nor full training datasets are needed.  We show the effectiveness of these techniques for popular models used for inference on resource constrained devices.

**Harris Teague** is Principal Engineer/Manager at Qualcomm and leads the Platform Systems group at Qualcomm AI Research.  Prior to focusing on machine learning, he worked on a range of wireless projects including Bluetooth, WCDMA, ultra-wideband, and an OFDMA-based precursor to LTE called UMB.  Harris is an inventor on over 60 granted US patents.  He holds a BS degree in Aerospace Engineering from Virginia Tech, and MS and PhD in Aerospace from Stanford University.
