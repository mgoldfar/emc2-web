AI has now touched most of our lives. Voice assistants and smart speakers e.g. Amazon Alexa, Google home or Apple Siri are being used by most of us many times
daily. While these are consumer devices at home for personal use, these rely on the AI compute being done in the cloud or in the data center. However issues around privacy, 24/7 connectivity, latency etc. are driving the recent push towards “on device AI”. While in many cases, these Edge devices today are plugged into the wall or use rechargeable batteries that are charged daily, there are a large number applications, emerging in speech/audio, vision, sensor fusion etc. where AI must run without internet connectivity on portable battery operated devices for a longtime without recharging. These devices need to have a very small form fac or and must be extremely energy efficient as in many cases the AI engine must always be on. This on one hand poses technical challenges and need for much innovation but on the other hand this opens up new opportunities and business growth. In this talk we will focus on the challenges, possible ways to solve them and briefly discuss a few possible opportunities.
