Craylm is a fully open source, CC-0 Licensed (unrestricted commercial use), integrated LLM inference and training platform. We created Craylm to simplify the development of reinforcement learning agents with advanced reasoning and memory capabilities, similar to those of DeepSeek R1. By integrating inference and training engines into a single platform, Craylm enables the seamless generation and utilization of reasoning trajectories for training updates, streamlining the development process. Craylm builds on top of the vLLM inference engine, the Megatron-LM training framework, and the HuggingFace model hub. It unifies the capabilities of these tools into a single platform, enabling users to easily perform LLM inference and training, and build higher level applications such as LLM-Agents.
