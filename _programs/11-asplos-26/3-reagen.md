abstract: "AI is great. It powers many of our favorite services and drives industries. However, today's solutions pose a tradeoff between utility and privacy where receiving the highest quality service often requires disclosing private information. In this talk I will show how things don't have to be this way. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic method that enables computation directly on encrypted data, never disclosing sensitive inputs while still enabling access to high-quality services. I will then cover the challenges of using this technology, which include both extreme performance overhead and programming difficulty, and how our Orion framework addresses them. Finally, I will highlight our most recent work that demonstrates how FHE can be applied to neural recommendation. Time permitting, a demonstration will be given."
