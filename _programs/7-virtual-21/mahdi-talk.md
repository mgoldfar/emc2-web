As the demand for video and machine learning workloads increases, the memory bandwidth wall, and data movement problems escalate in all forms of computing systems--from edge devices and mobile nodes to data centers. Despite the recent technological enhancements in memory systems, the emerging data-intensive applications (e.g., point clouds and ML workloads) are still bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth and energy-efficiency of today's memory hierarchies. This talk examines a few examples of our architectural solutions to efficient data processing. First, we introduce a novel data structure based on geometric arrays (G-Arrays) that allow fast and energy-efficient point cloud processing in a compressed format. In addition to a 50% reduction in memory footprint, the proposed G-Arrays format achieves a significant speedup over the state-of-the-art PCL and MPEG libraries for point operations such as kNN search, point merge, and projection. Next, we examine a novel mechanism for index-independent data ranking in memory. The proposed algorithm is capable of eliminating all pairwise comparisons for data ranking, thereby reducing the memory bandwidth significantly. When applied to off-chip non-volatile memory arrays, the proposed mechanism achieves two orders of magnitude performance gains, and 90% energy reduction compared to the existing methods.
