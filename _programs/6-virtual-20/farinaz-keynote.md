Machine Learning on encrypted data is a yet-to-be-addressed challenge. Several recent key advances across different layers of the system, from cryptography and mathematics to logic synthesis and hardware are paving the way for energy-efficient realization of privacy preserving computing for certain target applications.
This keynote talk highlights the crucial role of hardware and advances in computing architecture in supporting the recent progresses in the field. I outline the main technologies and mixed computing models. I particularly center my talk on the recent progress in synthesis of Garbled Circuits that provide a leap in scalable realization of energy efficient machine learning on encrypted data.  I explore how hardware could pave the way for navigating the complex parameter selection and scalable future mixed protocol solutions. I conclude by briefly discussing the challenges and opportunities moving forward.

**Farinaz Koushanfar** received her Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science as well as an M.A. in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2005. From 2006 to 2015, she was a faculty in Rice University where she served as assistant, associate and full professor of electrical and computer engineering. Her primary research interests are domain-specific computing, embedded systems, secure computing, protection of hardware, embedded and IoT systems, as well as design automation, in particular automation of emerging data driven learning and massive data analytic algorithms. At UC San Diego, she plans to continue her work on next generation of efficient and secure data-driven computing and embedded/IoT devices and systems.
