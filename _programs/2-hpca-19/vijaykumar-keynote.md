Advances in machine learning (ML) are resulting in highly-accurate recognition (e.g., image and speech recognition).  ML models, however, place high computational demand during both training and inference, requiring efficient architectures. The models? computations are fine-grained, regular and highly parallel, have high data reuse, and use low-precision arithmetic for inference (e.g., int8).  Modern ML architectures (e.g., GPGPUs, TPU, and FPGA-based) exploit these characteristics to achieve high performance and energy efficiency.

Recently, ML models have been shown to be sparse, prompting creative proposals for sparse architectures.  Emerging technology trends of processing-in/near-memory match some of the ML workloads well providing an opportunity for architectural innovation based on these innovative technologies.  In this talk, I will explore these exciting aspects of machine learning architectures.

**T. N. Vijaykumar** is Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. His research interests are in computer architecture targeting machine learning architectures, secure high-performance microprocessors, and verifiable architectures. He is also interested in hardware for data center networks and software-programmable microfluidics. His work has been recognized with an NSF CAREER Award in 1999 and IEEE Micros Top Picks in 2003 and 2005. He is listed in the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) Hall of Fame at [http://research.cs.wisc.edu/arch/www/iscabibhall](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/arch/www/iscabibhall). With his colleagues, he received the first prize in the 2009 Burton D. Morgan Business Plan Competition for a business plan on commercializing software-programmable lab-on-a-chip technology. He received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1997.
