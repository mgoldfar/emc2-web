Energy efficiency is at the heart of powering the future.  It begins with accelerated computing, but it is applied in system design all the way up to the data center management level.  In this talk, we explore what it takes to be power efficient, scalable, partitionable, and programmable.  We highlight efficiency at the data center level, and advocate improvements over time in tools that offer guidance to users and automate the process of more efficient and secure performance.
