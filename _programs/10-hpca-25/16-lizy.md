Mainstream artificial neural network models, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are computation-heavy and energy-hungry.  Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are natively built with RAM-based neurons and represent an entirely distinct type of neural network computing compared to DNNs. WNNs are extremely low-latency, low-energy, and suitable for efficient, accurate,  edge inference. The WNN approach derives an implicit inspiration from the decoding process observed in the dendritic trees of biological neurons, making neurons based on Random Access Memories (RAMs) and/or Lookup Tables (LUTs) ready-to-deploy neuromorphic digital circuits. This talk will describe the state of the art of Weightless Neural Networks, and their applications for edge inferencing. It will also present Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. Techniques such as Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of DWN models for edge inferencing will be discussed.
