While generative AI offers transformative potential, its rapid scaling has introduced significant challenges in sustainability and responsible deployment. This talk explores the role of caching in AI systems, including both performance and its broader implications for sustainability and security. First, I will present our recent work on improving the efficiency of video generation systems through caching techniques. I will then discuss our context caching system that explores the trade-off between operational carbon savings and the increased embodied carbon associated with storage. Finally, I will highlight our recent findings on novel security vulnerabilities arising from caching mechanisms used in image generation services.
