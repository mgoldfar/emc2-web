Neural architecture search (NAS) has attracted significant attention in the machine learning community in recent years. Although architectures found by NAS are able to achieve superior performance than manually designed neural architectures, the key bottleneck of neural architecture search is its extremely high search cost. In this talk, I want to shed light on the importance of architecture encoding on enhancing the efficiency of NAS. In particular, I will talk about two works on architecture encoding. The first work, dubbed arch2vec, proposes an unsupervised learning-based architecture encoding method that decouples architecture representation learning and architecture search into two separate processes. The second work, dubbed CATE, proposes to encode computations instead of structures of neural architectures via a transformer-based encoder. Our experimental results on widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of our proposed methods. 

**Dr. Mi Zhang** is an Associate Professor and the Director of the Machine Learning Systems Lab at Michigan State University. He received his Ph.D. from University of Southern California and B.S. from Peking University. Before joining MSU, he was a postdoctoral scholar at Cornell University. His research lies at the intersection of systems and machine learning, spanning areas including Efficient Deep Learning, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), Federated Learning, Systems for Machine Learning, and Machine Learning for Systems. He is the 4th Place Winner of the 2019 Google MicroNet Challenge, the Third Place Winner of the 2017 NSF Hearables Challenge, and the champion of the 2016 NIH Pill Image Recognition Challenge. He is the recipient of six best paper awards and nominations. He is also the recipient of the Facebook Faculty Research Award, Amazon Machine Learning Research Award, and MSU Innovation of the Year Award.
