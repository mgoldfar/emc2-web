Edge AI applications retain the need for high-performing inference models, while driving platforms beyond their limits of energy efficiency and throughput. Digital hardware acceleration, enabling 10-100x gains over general-purpose architectures, is already widely deployed, but is ultimately restricted by data-movement and memory accessing that dominates deep-learning computations. In-memory computing, based on both SRAM and emerging memory, offers fundamentally new tradeoffs for overcoming these barriers, with the potential for 10x higher energy efficiency and area-normalized throughput demonstrated in recent designs. But, those tradeoffs instate new challenges, especially affecting scaling to the level of computations required, integration in practical heterogeneous architectures, and mapping of diverse software. This talk examines those tradeoffs to characterize the challenges. It then explores recent research that provides promising paths forward, making in-memory computing more of a practical reality than ever before.

**Naveen Verma** received the B.A.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the UBC, Vancouver, Canada in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Since July 2009 he has been a faculty member at Princeton University. His research focuses on advanced sensing systems, exploring how systems for learning, inference, and action planning can be enhanced by algorithms that exploit new sensing and computing technologies. This includes research on large-area, flexible sensors, energy-efficient statistical-computing architectures and circuits, and machine-learning and statistical-signal-processing algorithms. Prof. Verma has served as a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society, and currently serves on the technical program committees for ISSCC, VLSI Symp., DATE, and IEEE Signal-Processing Society (DISPS).
