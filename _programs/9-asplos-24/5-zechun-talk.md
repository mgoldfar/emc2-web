<a href="">Slides</a> <a href="">Video</a><br>Large language models (LLMs) are permeating various facets of human life,
influencing not only communication and work but also shaping everyday entertainment
experiences. Due to limitations in memory size and computational cost, there is an
increasing demand to deploy LLM on smartphones and mobile devices. To address
these challenges, a new research direction has emerged that focuses on downsizing
LLMs for on-device inference. This includes techniques such as model compression,
deployment acceleration, small model design, etc. In this talk, we will discuss the
constraints and solutions for optimizing models in on-device use cases as well as
practical methods for LLM quantization.
